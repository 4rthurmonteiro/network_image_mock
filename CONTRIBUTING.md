# Contributing to Network Image Mock

The rules are quite simple.

## Issues

Whenever you open an issue, start issue title with **SLNIM-#:**, where **#** denotes
the number of issue (this is not to be confused with GitHub numbering, since that numbering also includes pull requests). So, if the latest issue has a number SLNIM-13, you name the issue like _SLNIM-14: Bump mockito_.

However, if you just have a question, omit the numbering!

## Pull requests

Before you open a pull request, always open an issue first! After that,
you open a pull request which should be named the same as issue, with
**SLNIM-#:** the same as the issue of course.
